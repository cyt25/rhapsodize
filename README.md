# rhapsodize
**Info 4120 Final Project**

Rhapsodize is an Android application (4.1+) that uses the CMUSphinx speech recognition API 
to continuously detect speech for crutch word occurrences. It notifies the user when these words are 
said and also keeps track of how often they are said so that the user can keep track of progress. Though 
ideally the application would be used throughout the day to keep track of the user’s speech in daily 
conversation, this would lead to privacy concerns as well as many more technical challenges in making 
the application more than simply proof of concept. As a result, Rhapsodize is to be used as a 
speech­practice­buddy. The user places the phone running Rhapsodize in front of him or herself while 
practicing giving a speech and the device will detect and count crutch word occurrences.
